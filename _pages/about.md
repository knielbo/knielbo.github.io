__Hi, I'M KRISTOFFER L. NIELBO__  
I'm a researcher and infrastructure manager at Aarhus University Denmark. As a researcher, I use a computionational and data-driven approach to understand the _dynamics of sociocultural systems_. As an infrastructure manger, I strive to empower and accelerate humanities and social science research through _interactive computing_ and _collaborative development_. Throughout my academic career, I have participated in a range inter- and transdisciplinary research projects that have explored the _cultural information space_ aided by statistics, computer algorithms, and visualization.



Current Projects
======
Currently I am working on a comparative study of *innovation*, *creativity* and *motivational drivers* in Danish textual cultural heritage, with a particular focus on N.F.S Grundtvig (1783-1872), H.C. Andersen (1805-1875) and S.A. Kierkegaard (1813-1855) (see, [*A Curious Case of Entropic Decay*](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy054)).

With my Dutch colleague Melvin Wevers, I work on a large-scale automated text analysis project about *disruptions* and *persistence* in Dutch newspapers topicality space. The project is a continuation of our previous project with Jianbo Gao *Tracking the Consumption Junction:Temporal Dependencies in Dutch Newspaper Articles and Advertisements* (still in review!).

Jianbo Gao, Mads Rosendahl Thomsen and me have recently started a project on the fractal properties of narratives, which has led us to propose a set of theoretical propositions on the necessary properties of optimal narrative structure (*Dynamic evolution of sentiments in Never Let Me Go: Insights from multifractal theory and its implications for literary analysis*,  currently in review).


Centre for Humanities Computing Aarhus
======
As of February 1, 2019, Aarhus University has established [Centre for Humanities Computing Aarhus](http://chcaa.io/#/) (CHCAA). The centre forms the spearhead of computational literacy for researchers in the Humanities.  We adopt, research and develop tomorrow's data-driven humanities methodologies, tools, and synergies. Our aim is to empower researchers with relevant, efficient, and usable resources and mindsets. We acquire, research, and develop state-of-the-art technologies, methodologies, and best practices for research on digital data in the Humanities. The CHCAA maintains a working pipeline to produce the best learning material for you to acquire relevant cutting edge technologies in a humane format.

Calculus of Culture @ Aarhus University
======
Calculus of Culture is a interdisciplinary research network (members from humanities, CS and mathematics) that has been meeting twice during 2017 (Guangxi University/China & Aarhus University/Denmark) in order to develop methods and tools for data-driven research of culture. We just finished our meeting at Aarhus University (core participants in picture).

Scandinavian Literature Hack @ University of California Los Angeles
======
November 13-14, 2017 I participated in a hackfest event working on Scandinavian literature at UCLA (!!!) funded by the Mellon Foundation. After a sleepless night, we
presented a study of optimality criteria for fairy tales (and other fiction) tested on 8000+ Danish documents. H.C Andersen turns out to be the paradigm of literary optimality.

Culture Analytics Reunion @ Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (UCLA)
======
December 11-15, 2017, the Culture Analytics group from Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics had their first reuion at the Lake Arrowhead retreat in California. Take-home message: *Math Changes Everything*
