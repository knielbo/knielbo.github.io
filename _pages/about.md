I'm a researcher and infrastructure manager at Aarhus University Denmark. As a researcher, I use a computionational and data-driven approach to understand the _dynamics of sociocultural systems_. As an infrastructure manger, I strive to empower and accelerate humanities and social science research through _interactive computing_ and _collaborative development_. Throughout my academic career, I have participated in a range inter- and transdisciplinary research projects that have explored the _cultural information space_ aided by statistics, computer algorithms, and visualization.

Current Projects
======

Together with my colleagues [Rebekah Baglini](https://rbkh.net/), [Peter B. Vahlstrup](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/peter-bjerregaard-vahlstrup(63997fd6-cf3c-4d7e-895a-7cfbd145f22e).html) and PhD student [Kenneth Enevoldsen](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/kenneth-christian-enevoldsen(c52b8fd4-bd44-4c8e-997b-648715fd0d0d).html), I am currently developing an algorithm for change detection in written media content. The project is part of the [HOPE](https://hope-project.dk/#/) How Democracies Cope with COVID19 project that is funded by the [Carlsberg Foundation](https://www.carlsbergfondet.dk/en/News/News-from-the-Foundation/News/25-million-DKK-to-social-behavioral-research-during-the-Covid19-epidemic). (see, [News Information Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02956.pdf) and [When No News Is Bad News](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.06505.pdf).

Mads Rosendahl Thomsen and I have received funding from the [Velux Foundation](https://veluxfoundations.dk/da/content/kaerlighed-og-vrede-syv-humanvidenskabelige-projekter-saetter-hverdagen-i-perspektiv) to develop Fabula-NET, a decision support system for quality assessment of fiction that combines automated narrative analysis with with market intelligence and demographic factors. With Fabula-NET, we promote transparent and bias awareness algorithmic decision making.

With my colleague [Katrine F. Baunvig](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/katrine-froekjaer-baunvig(f1e19ea4-6952-423e-930a-2bd93623a9d4).html) I am working on a comparative study of *innovation*, *creativity* and *motivational drivers* in Danish textual cultural heritage, with a particular focus on N.F.S Grundtvig (1783-1872), H.C. Andersen (1805-1875) and S.A. Kierkegaard (1813-1855) (see, [*A Curious Case of Entropic Decay*](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqy054)).

[Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus](http://chcaa.io/#/) has joined the consortium behind [DeiC](https://www.deic.dk/)'s [Type 1 HPC Interactive system](https://www.deic.dk/en/supercomputing/national-hpc-facilities). Together with collegues from University of Southern Denmark's [SDU eScience Center](https://escience.sdu.dk/) and Aalborg University's [CLAAUDIA](https://www.claaudia.aau.dk/), we work to provide researchers easy access to interactive computing in the [cloud](https://cloud.sdu.dk/app/login/selection).  

I manage [Nordic Digital Humanities Laboratory](https://centre-for-humanities-computing.github.io/Nordic-Digital-Humanities-Laboratory/) a collaboration around a shared software and application layer for modeling and analysis of cultural heritage data across the Nordics. NDHL is funded by the [Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration](https://neic.no/) (NeIC).

Previous Projects
======

With my colleagues [Melvin Wevers](http://www.melvinwevers.nl/) and Jianbo Gao, I have published a study on a large-scale automated text analysis project about *long-range dependence* (LRD) and the effects of advertisments  in Dutch newspapers: [Tracking the Consumption Junction:Temporal Dependencies in Dutch Newspaper Articles and Advertisements](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/14/2/000445/000445.html).

Jianbo Gao, Mads Rosendahl Thomsen and I have published a study on the fractal properties of narratives, which led us to propose a set of theoretical propositions on the necessary properties of optimal narrative structure: [Dynamic evolution of sentiments in Never Let Me Go: Insights from multifractal theory and its implications for literary analysis](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02143896/document)


Centre for Humanities Computing Aarhus
======
As of February 1, 2019, Aarhus University has established [Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus](http://chcaa.io/#/) (CHCAA). The centre forms the spearhead of computational literacy for researchers in the Humanities.  We adopt, research and develop tomorrow's data-driven humanities methodologies, tools, and synergies. Our aim is to empower researchers with relevant, efficient, and usable resources and mindsets. We acquire, research, and develop state-of-the-art technologies, methodologies, and best practices for research on digital data in the Humanities. The CHCAA maintains a working pipeline to produce the best learning material for you to acquire relevant cutting edge technologies in a humane format.

Calculus of Culture @ Aarhus University
======
Calculus of Culture is a interdisciplinary research network (members from humanities, CS and mathematics) that has been meeting twice during 2017 (Guangxi University/China & Aarhus University/Denmark) in order to develop methods and tools for data-driven research of culture. We just finished our meeting at Aarhus University (core participants in picture).

Scandinavian Literature Hack @ University of California Los Angeles
======
November 13-14, 2017 I participated in a hackfest event working on Scandinavian literature at UCLA (!!!) funded by the Mellon Foundation. After a sleepless night, we
presented a study of optimality criteria for fairy tales (and other fiction) tested on 8000+ Danish documents. H.C Andersen turns out to be the paradigm of literary optimality.

Culture Analytics Reunion @ Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics (UCLA)
======
December 11-15, 2017, the Culture Analytics group from Institute of Pure and Applied Mathematics had their first reuion at the Lake Arrowhead retreat in California. Take-home message: *Math Changes Everything*
