As a humanities researcher I have specialized in applications of quantitative methods and computational tools in analysis, interpretation and storage of cultural data. I have participated in a range of collaborative and interdisciplinary research projects involving researchers from the humanities, social sciences, health science, and natural sciences. My research covers two areas of interest of which one is more recent (automated text analysis) and the other (modeling of cultural behavior) has followed me during my entire academic career. Both interests explore the cultural information space in new and innovative ways by combining cultural data and humanities theories with statistics, computer algorithms, and visualization.


Current Projects
======
Currently I am working on a comparative study of *innovation*, *creativity* and *motivational drivers* in Danish textual cultural heritage, with a particular focus on N.F.S Grundtvig (1783-1872), H.C. Andersen (1805-1875) and S.A. Kierkegaard (1813-1855).

======
University of Southern Denmark hosts Denmark's largest supercomputer [Abacus 2.0](https://abacus.deic.dk/). In order to facilitate use of the Abacus 2.0 in the humanities and computationaly empower our domain experts, we have established *datakuben*, an eScience unit for the humanities and arts.

Calculus of Culture @ Aarhus University
======
Calculus of Culture is a interdisciplinary research network (members from humanities, CS and mathematics) that has been meeting twice during 2017 (Guangxi University/China & Aarhus University/Denmark) in order to develop methods and tools for data-driven research of culture. We just finished our meeting at Aarhus University (core participants in picture).

Scandinavian Literature Hack @ University of California Los Angeles
======
November 13-14, 2017 I participated in a hackfest event working on Scandinavian literature at UCLA (!!!) funded by the Mellon Foundation. After a sleepless night, we
presented a study of optimality criteria for fairy tales (and other fiction) tested on 8000+ Danish documents. H.C Andersen turns out to be the paradigm of literary optimality.
