Characterizing ritual and ritualized behaviors has been a core issue in anthropology
and the study of religion for more than a century. Although varying in
emphasis, most theories point toward several specific behavioral features that
distinguish ritual from instrumental behavior. Specifically, we have chosen to
focus on the derivedness from instrumental behavior, intentional underspecification
and goal-demotion. In contrast to instrumental or functional behavior (i.e.,
actions that cohere causally and have a necessary integration of subparts), we
propose to view ritual and ritualized action as sub-categories of non-functional
behavior (i.e., actions lacking causal coherence and a necessary integration
between subparts). New insights in human action processing can help us explain
how cognition might vary depending on the type of behavior processed. Using an
event segmentation paradigm, we conducted two experiments eliciting differences
in participants’ response patterns to functional and non-functional actions.
Participants consistently segmented non-functional action sequences into smaller
units indicating either an attentional shift to the level of gesture analysis or a
problem of representational integration. Experimental studies of non-functional
behavior can strengthen explanations of recurrent features of human action
processing, such as ritual and ritualized behavior, as well as indicate potential
sources and effects of breakdown of the system.
