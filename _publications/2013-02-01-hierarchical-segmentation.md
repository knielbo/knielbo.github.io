Both folk and scientific taxonomies of behavior distinguish between instru-
mental and ritual behavior. Recent studies indicate that behaviors dominated
by ritual features tend to increase cognitive load by focusing attentional and
working memory resources on low-level perceptual details and psycho-physics.
In contrast to the general consensus on ritual in anthropology and the study of
religion, one study did not find any modulation effect of expectations (e.g., cultural
information or priors) on cognitive load. It has, therefore, been suggested that
the increase reflects a perceptual mechanism that drives categorization of ritu-
al behavior. The present study investigated how an increase in cognitive load
elicited by ritual behavior can influence hierarchically-related representations
of actions and if expectation can modulate such hierarchical action represen-
tations. The study found that hierarchical alignment during segmentation of
actions with ritual features was reduced in comparison to instrumental actions
but that expectations only vaguely modulate this reduction. It is argued that
these results lend support to the resource depletion model ritual behavior.
