How do cultural and religious rituals influence human perception and
cognition, and what separates the highly patterned behaviors of
communal ceremonies from perceptually similar precautionary and
compulsive behaviors? These are some of the questions that recent
theoretical models and empirical studies have tried to answer by
focusing on ritualized behavior instead of ritual. Ritualized behavior (i.e.,
a set of behavioral features embedded in rituals) increases attention to
detail and induces cognitive resource depletion, which together support
distinct modes of action categorization. While ritualized behaviors are
perceptually similar across a range of behavioral domains, symbolically
mediated experience-dependent information (so-called cultural priors)
modulate perception such that communal ceremonies appear coherent
and culturally meaningful, while compulsive behaviors remain
incoherent and, in some cases, pathological.
In this study, we extend a qualitative model of human action
perception and understanding to include ritualized behavior. Based on
previous experimental and computational studies, the model was
simulated using instrumental and ritualized representations of realistic
motor patterns and the simulation data were subjected to linear and
non-linear analysis. The results are used to exemplify how action
perception of ritualized behavior (a) might influence allocation of
attentional resources and (b) can be modulated by cultural priors.
Further explorations of the model show why behavioral experiments
might fail to capture modulation effects of cultural priors and that
cultural priors in general reduce the chaoticity of time-dependent action
processing.
