In the backdrop of interests in social media news and polarization the aim of this study is to
examine to what extent we are exposed to the same “news” in the News Feed? The article
defines news not from a classical position but from the content that is judged relevant to the
user and made visible by the algorithm. The study examines filter bubbles as information simi-
larity and more specifically nonoverlapping content segments in a unique snapshot dataset of
14 days of personal Facebook News Feeds for 1,000 Danes mirroring the Danish Facebook
population. Deploying methods to analyze both link sources and content semantics the study
finds that less than 10% in the link source analysis and 27.8% in the semantic analysis are in
a filter bubble. The article tests and discusses suitable conceptual and empirical thresholds for
information similarity that can inspire future studies. The best significant predictors for being
in a filter bubble are what we term sociality: number of page likes, group memberships and
friends. The study does not find age, gender, education or area of residence isolated to be sig-
nificant predictors of participants in filter bubbles.
