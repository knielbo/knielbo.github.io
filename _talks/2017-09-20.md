The recent explosion in digitized and digital text-media is rapidly changing the evidential basis for the humanities. While the humanities used to be the principal scientific consumers of text-based data, the majority of text analysis is now performed by 'machines' outside traditional humanistic domains. Text & Data Mining (TDM) applies machine learning in order to extract useful knowledge from from large collections of linguistic data. This workshop will showcase multiple techniques for building TDM tools based on the popular programming language Python.
